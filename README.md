<h1>Wazuh Siem Homelab</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This home lab simply illustrates how we can install a WAZUH instance on a cloud provider service which is called Linode and it is then configured as a SSH connection or we can apply Reverse DNS to open the interface in our browser. Additonally, we add the new agents in our Wazuh manager as that could be our Window Machine, Linux Machine or any other host machine agent we want to monitor and control. To summarize, this SIEM tool has numerous advantages in the field of cybersecurity as not only does it help to monitor the anomalies, vulnerabilities, data and network events it also helps in automating the responses in the desired way efficiently.
